<h2 style="color:#1976D2">JOB DESCRIPTION :</h2>
<p>Every business that generates its own computer programs or needs to personalize third-party
software needs software engineers to write, edit and test programs. There are many layers of 
computer software, and each requires a specialist in languages specific to that layer.</p> 
<p>Software engineering is a rapidly changing field: training in software is available at nearly all learning 
institutions, and most software engineers continue to learn on the job, as languages and development
environments evolve.</p>
<p>Software engineers tend to specialize in a few areas of development, such as networks, 
operating systems, databases or applications, and each area requires fluency in its own
set of computer languages and development environments.</p>
<p>A small percentage of software engineers work alone, but most collaborate with other specialists in development groups all working
together to create complex projects.</p>
