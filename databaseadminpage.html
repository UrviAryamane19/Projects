<h1 style="color:#E64A19">DATABASE ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<h2 style="color:#FF6E40">Required skills</h2>
<p>For a role in database management, employers will be looking for you to have the following:</p>
<p>Strong analytical and organisational skills<br>
<p>Eye for detail and accuracy<br>
<p>Understanding of structured query language (SQL)<br>
<p>Knowledge of 'relational database management systems' (RDBMS),'object oriented database management systems' (OODBMS),and XML database management systems</p>
<p>Experience with their database software/web applications</p>
<p>The ability to work quickly, under pressure and to deadlines</p>
<p>Up-to-date knowledge of technology and the Data Protection Act</p>
<p>Ability to work well in a fast paced environment, where the technology is constantly changing</p>
<h2 style="color:#FF8F00">Entry requirements</h2>
<p>When it comes to qualifications, operational knowledge or experience is seen as very important,
but a relevant degree or equivalent can help you enter the industry at a higher position.</p>
<p>Much of the necessary experience required for this type of role can be gained through a previous job 
in IT support, programming or web development. Alternatively, there are entry routes through graduate
training programmes and apprenticeship schemes.</p>
<h2 style="color:#FF8F00">Training</h2>
<p>As it is likely the technology you will be using will constantly be changing and upgrading, you will have
to keep up-to-date with the latest modifications. This can be achieved through on the job training,
mentoring and professional development courses.</p>

<p>As an entry level database administrator, you'll probably be <h1 style="color:#039BE5">earning between (pounds)22,000 and (pounds)26,000 a year.</h1>
After three years of experience this will rise significantly to <h1 style="color:#039BE5">(pounds)30,000 to (pounds)35,000.</h1> Those with a decade
or more of experience are known to earn up to <h2 style="color:#039BE5">(pounds)50,000. More than 65% of all database administrator
positions are in London and the South East,</h1> which means salaries will often be above average.</p>
<p>Depending on your level of responsibility, typical tasks may include:
Assisting in database design<br>
Updating and amending existing databases<br>
Setting up and testing new database and data handling systems<br>
Monitoring database efficiency<br>
Sustaining the security and integrity of data<br>
Creating complex query definitions that allow data to be extracted<br>
Training colleagues in how to input and extract data<br>
Increasingly, the role of a database administrator is defined by the particular processes 
and capabilities of the database management system in place.</p>
<p>However, the work you do will greatly assist other members of the organisation, including analysts,
programmers and IT managers who all require reports to collate information for planning, reference
and communications purposes.</p>
